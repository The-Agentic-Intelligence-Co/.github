## Agentic Intelligence Co.

We build open-source AI tools because advanced technology should be accessible to anyone, not just those who can pay for it.

This organization hosts projects that make AI, automation, and creative tools practical and usable for creators, developers, and everyone.

## Projects

- **Dom-Engine** â€“ TypeScript library that converts website DOMs into actionable context for AI browser agents and RPA flows.
- **Eclipse** â€“ Chrome extension for browser automation, multi-tab chat, video analysis, and tab management features, just BYOK.  
- **VibeMotion** â€“ Generate UI motion graphics videos with AI prompts.  
- **Walt** â€“ A computer-use AI agent that learns workflows through screen-sharing and voice guidance, then runs them for you.   
- **Virality** â€“ Turn long videos into viral-ready short clips for influencers and content creators.  

> Projects are rolling out one by one â€” all fully open-source.
